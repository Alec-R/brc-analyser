# Simple Structured Product Analyser
This streamlit based application enables the user to compare a list of stocks and check their projected financial ratios given a specific scenario.
A typical use case would be to analyse the basket of underlying stocks for a barrier reverse convertible product.
The product barrier can be entered and used as a worst case analysis to see how the stock valuation would look like if the barrier is breached.

To run the dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_dash.py
```

## Setup
1. Create a new python env
2. Run the dashboard with the streamlit command

## Requirements
Python 3.12
Pandas 2.2
Streamlit 1.3
